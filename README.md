# AudioClassificationSystem-using-python-with-GUI
The Audio Classification System is designed to categorize urban sounds by utilizing advanced machine learning techniques. The system processes audio data by extracting Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to serve as feature representations. A neural network model, constructed and trained using TensorFlow/Keras, is employed to identify and classify distinct sound patterns accurately. Additionally, the system incorporates real-time audio recording and classification functionalities, facilitated through the integration of SoundDevice and Wavio libraries. A user-friendly graphical interface, developed with Tkinter, allows users to interact effortlessly, enabling the upload, recording, and immediate classification of audio files. This system is applicable in various scenarios, including noise monitoring and sound recognition tasks, offering both static and dynamic audio analysis capabilities.
